# Roxo-Gaming-Test

Hi ! This is my attempt at completing the RoxorGaming test. 
This is meant to be a simple REST API returning the string "pong" on http://localhost:8080/ping.
To run this application, open the folder on an IDE properly setup to run a Spring Boot application. Then, under the folder src/main/java/com.example.demo, run the file DemoApplication.
Whilst the application is running, open http://localhost:8080/ping on your local browser. The word "pong" should appear on the page.

Many thanks for your time !
Pipo.
